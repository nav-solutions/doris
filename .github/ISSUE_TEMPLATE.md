## Issue reporting

Thank you for using our library and trying to make it better 🛰️ 🌍

## Error reporting

When reporting an issue related to one of our libraries, an error log will suffice.

If your post-processing pipeline is complex and involves very specific data, it may be required
that you provide your data set so we can replicate the issue. To do so, you can contact us on Discord
(does not have to a public message), by email or on Github.
